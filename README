*originally recorded in garage band.
*used "helium voice" for the vocals
*sped up the song, I played it a bit to slow. It's nice that garage band doesn't change the pitch :-)
*I removed one line from the solo and replaced copy/pasted

Lyrics

Da, da, da _why, _why, _why, _why, feeling Ruby
Da, da, da _why, _why, _why, You got me feeling Ruby
Oh _why, I'm so high, so high on my Ruby
Oh _why, I'm so high, so high on my Ruby
Da, da, da _why, _why, _why, _why, feeling Ruby
Da, da, da _why, _why, _why, You got me feeling Ruby
